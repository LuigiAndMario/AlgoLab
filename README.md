# AlgoLab 2019

My solutions for ETHZ's Algorithms Lab class, given in 2019. For (some of) the 2018 solutions, check out the 2018 branch.

Solutions may not be optimal, and score below 100. Some problems are not done already.

Usually, the best solution is the one in `name_of_the_problem.cpp`. The files `name_of_the_problem x.cpp` are solution working for fewer points (1 usually scoring the lowest, then 2, then 3).
